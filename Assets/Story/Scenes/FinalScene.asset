    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: I'm sorry for not being enough. For leaving you by yourself all the time.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: ...That's not true.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: You don't have to pretend anymore. I can see it in your eyes. You resent
      me.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: No I don't! I don't.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: Don't lie to yourself. We both know it's true.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: So what if I do resent you?  I don't get why you're bringing this up now
      if you've known it for years. And I also don't get why you wouldn't come home
      on time for one, or be there for my concerts and my competitions, if you already
      knew how much that hurt me.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: I was afraid. I didn't know what I was doing. I was so tired all the time.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: That's not an excuse. You think I wasn't afraid? Did you think I knew what
      I was doing? I was just a kid.

  - text: I don't want to talk about this now. It didn't matter that much to me anyway.
      I'm an adult now. I've moved on. We're good now.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: ...Yes. We are.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: Now can we leave?
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: I can't.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: What do you mean?
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: I love you. I'm sorry I didn't say it more.

  - text: I failed you in so many ways when I was alive. At least I get to speak
      with you one last time.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: What did you just say? When you were alive? We're both alive right now.
      You haven't been making any sense since I first found you here. First that
      nonsense about being sorry, and now this. We have to leave so we can go...
      go somewhere. Where were we going? Why can't I remember? Where are we?
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: I think you know.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: I'm... we're...
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: There was... there was a truck, and so much fire, and then...

    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 767f4a335c251d045903e59d03da6d13, type: 2}
  - text: That's why you said sorry? Because you realized that it's already too late?
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}

  - text: I don't forgive you. You're right. You never were enough. And I know you
      tried to be more, but you weren't. I can't forgive you, but... I still love
      you. Because that's all I can do. Because it's easier to pretend, and it hurts
      less that way. The same way it was easier for you to give me Mr. Snuffles than
      to be there for me yourself. I know that's probably not what you wanted to
      hear, but...
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
  - text: "\u2026 It\u2019s the truth. We could spend years unpacking the ways we\u2019ve
      let each other down. But what we have now the phone calls, weekend dinners
      together, silly fights over dumb TV shows I want to hold on to that.  "
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 37f4651f28d626e49a720f03e93963ee, type: 2}
